    "In this article, the authors work on the flowering of Arabidopsis, depending on the temperature. In fact, the cold has an effect on the epigenetic of the FLC gene which regulates the floral initiation. In summer the nucleosomes of the gene are slowly activated (for example by acetylation) whereas with the cold they are inactivated (by methylation).The parts of the nucleosomes that can be methylated are the histones H3 (two per nucleosome). This mechanism allows a \"winter memory\": the gene FLC is more and more inhibited by methylation with the cold. When spring comes back it is still methylated, promoting the flowering. Then with the high temperature it is slowly activated, and so the flowering doesn't begin directly at the begining of spring. Also nucleosomes are affected by the states of their neighbors, which means that when a nucleosome is activated it increases the chance of its neighbors to be activated as well and so it is when a nucleosome is methulated.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The authors modeled these epigenetic modifications with mathematical functions and in this project we used their data to model the modifications in Python. However, we changed some elements to make them functional in our system and to match our model. Also the values of some variables were chosen arbitrarily.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this system, when the cold arrives, the histones change between 3 states. They start by being activated and then they change to an undefined state followed by a methylated state. Moreover, in winter the histones can be nucleated which increases their probability to be in a methylated state. On the contrary, when the weather is warm they have a chance to be enucleated and to go to an activated state. "
